    <p class="description">Once, in a time long past, when the world was still young and magic flowed through the veins of the earth, there existed a magnificent creature—the last of its kind. This creature was no ordinary beast; it was a dragon named Aurelia.

Aurelia’s scales shimmered like molten gold, and her eyes held the wisdom of centuries. She lived atop the highest peak of the Emerald Mountains, where the air was thin, and the winds whispered secrets. Her wings spanned wide, casting shadows over valleys and forests below.

The world had changed since the days when dragons ruled the skies. Humans now feared them, hunted them for their scales and hearts, believing they held magical properties. But Aurelia was different. She harbored no malice toward humankind. Instead, she mourned the loss of her kin—the dragons who once soared alongside her.

One moonlit night, as the stars painted constellations across the heavens, Aurelia heard a cry—a desperate plea carried by the wind. It was the voice of a young girl named Elena, lost in the forest below. Elena had wandered far from her village, seeking adventure, unaware of the dangers that lurked.

Aurelia descended from her mountain perch, her wings slicing through the night. She found Elena trembling near a gnarled oak, tears streaming down her face. The girl’s innocence touched the dragon’s heart, and she vowed to protect her.

“Brave Elena,” Aurelia spoke, her voice like distant thunder. “Why are you here, so far from safety?”

Elena looked up, her eyes wide with wonder. “I seek the last dragon,” she said. “They say you hold the key to restoring magic to our world.”

Aurelia’s heart stirred. She had heard the legends—the prophecy that spoke of a chosen one who would reunite humans and dragons, bridging the gap between their worlds. Could Elena be that chosen one?

Together, they embarked on a quest. Aurelia taught Elena the ancient language of dragons—the words that could mend broken spells and heal wounded hearts. They traveled through enchanted forests, crossed treacherous rivers, and faced fire-breathing serpents.

As they neared the heart of the world, where magic pulsed like a living thing, Aurelia revealed her secret. She possessed a single dragon tear—a crystalline gem that held the essence of her kind. If Elena could unlock its power, perhaps they could restore balance.

But darkness loomed. A sorceress named Morgana, jealous of the bond between dragon and girl, sought to steal the tear. Morgana’s magic twisted the forests, turning them into thorny mazes. She sent her minions—shadow wolves and cursed knights—to hunt them down.

In the final battle, as Morgana’s dark magic threatened to consume them, Elena held the dragon tear aloft. Its light blazed, and Aurelia’s wings unfurled. She soared into the sky, flames trailing behind her. With a mighty roar, she shattered Morgana’s enchantments, freeing the land from darkness.

Elena and Aurelia stood together, their destinies entwined. The tear’s magic flowed through Elena, and she whispered the ancient words. The world trembled, and dragons reappeared—majestic and fierce, their wings blotting out the sun.

Aurelia wept tears of joy. She was no longer the last dragon. Elena had rekindled magic, and humans now saw dragons not as monsters but as allies. The Emerald Mountains echoed with their roars, and the skies danced with their flight.

And so, the legend of Aurelia and Elena spread across the land—a tale of courage, friendship, and the enduring magic that binds us all.</p>
